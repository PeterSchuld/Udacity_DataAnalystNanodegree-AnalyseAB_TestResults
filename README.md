# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree-Analyse AB_Test Results
Project No. 3 Practical Statistics in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Winter 2019/2020

#### Mentor:
 Lucrezia Morvilli, London

#### Motivation for the project
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important to get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

#### Project Description ####
For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

#### Data ####
The data and the Jupyter Notebook, which are all of the files we need to complete the project, are provided in a downloadable zip file by Udacity. Note that portions of the notebook reference back to quizzes that are linked in this lesson to ensure you are on the right track.
